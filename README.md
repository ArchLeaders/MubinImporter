# Mubin Importer - Blender Addon

A blender addon to import map unit binary files (mubin) into blender.

If you wish to use the Botw Shader option, you must contact Moonling and ask permission to use it.<br>Once you are granted that, contact me to get the required files.<br><br>
*If you do indeed have contact with Moonling, please ask if I can distribute the shader to everyone : )*

### Setup

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ArchLeaders/MubinImporter/releases/latest) and install it with blender.

2. Once installed, go to the Tools panel and click the 'Install Dependencies' button.<br>
   A console will appear and log the changes; it will take quite a while to complete.

3. Restart Blender
